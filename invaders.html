            This was the final project for my CS 1110: Intro to Python course in Fall 2018.
            It works similarly to the version you'd find anywhere on the internet.

        <p class = "one-line">
            Your screen starts with this when you first run the game:
        </p>
        <a>
            <img class = "screenshots" src = "start.png" alt = "The start screen says 'Press S to start'">
        </a>
        <p class = "caption">
            <br>Once 'S' has been pressed, the game begins. As you see in the picture below, you have to
            shoot at the aliens, but the aliens will be moving across the screen and shooting at you.
        </p>
        <a>
            <img class = "screenshots" src = "AfterStart.png" alt = "What a game looks like">
        </a>
        <p class = "caption">
            <br>You will move your spaceship left and right to try to destroy the aliens and avoid their
            shots. If you get shot, you lose a life and the pause screen appears.
        </p>
        <a>
            <img class = "screenshots" src = "Shot.png" alt = "Pause screen after getting shot">
        </a>
        <p class = "caption">
            <br>Your score is kept track of in the top left-hand corner (destroying closer aliens gets you
            less points than destroying aliens farther away), and the number of lives you have left
            is displayed in the top right-hand corner. You lose the game if you lose all your lives...
        </p>
        <a>
            <img class = "screenshots" src = "LoseNoLives.png" alt = "Game lost due to no lives left">

            <br>or if the aliens reach the line on the bottom before you destroy all of them.
        </p>
        <a>
            <img class = "screenshots" src = "LoseHitLine.png" alt = "Game lost due to aliens hitting bottom line">
        </a>
        <p class = "caption">
            <br>The video below shows a playthrough of the game. The game has 4 waves, and in each
            wave the aliens move 25% faster across the screen. The number of lives reset for each
            wave so the game isn't too difficult. I unfortunately couldn't beat my own game, but it
            can be done!
