            Below are many of the projects I have worked on either as class assignments or just for
            fun. Clicking on any of the project titles will lead you to another page where you can explore
            screenshots, watch a video of me using the project, and find a detailed description of what
            the project is. Code for any of the projects may be provided to prospective employers upon
            request.

                <p class = "desc">This website was 100% built and coded by me. I spent this past summer learning
                    HTML and CSS and applied what I'd learned to start building this online portfolio.
                    I've enjoyed designed the website and exploring a new aspect of computer science.
                    I'm used to being given assignments and following directions, so having to figure out
                    how to create this website on my own has been challenging but fun. There is no guidebook
                    online on how to make my exact vision come to life, so I've had to experiment and research
                    and find ways to make what I want happen. I hope you enjoy looking through the pages
                    here!

                <p class = "desc">My final project for CS 1110: Intro to Python in Fall 2018 was creating
                    this game. I'd coded before coming to college, but this project really excited me
                    and made me feel like I was cut out for computer science. Using everything I'd learned
                    in the class to code a game with multiple classes made me feel accomplished and I felt
                    as if I'd really learned a lot. Click on the title to explore more!
